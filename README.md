# GUID Extension

## Overview

This is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to generate and display a GUID at the bottom of the screen, making it easy for you to copy and use it wherever needed. The extension follows a simple and convenient approach by assigning shortcut keys for quick generation and insertion of GUIDs.

## Features

- **Shortcut Keys:** You can generate a GUID and display it at the bottom of the screen with just a keyboard shortcut. The default shortcut keys are:
    - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+B`
    - Mac: `Cmd+Shift+B`

- **Insert GUID at Cursor:** The extension creates a GUID at the location of your cursor in the editor.

## Usage

1. **Generate GUID:**
    - Use the designated shortcut keys to generate a GUID.
    
2. **Copy GUID:**
    - Once the GUID is displayed at the bottom of the screen, you can easily copy it for use in your code or other applications.

3. **Insert GUID at Cursor:**
    - Place your cursor in the desired location in the editor and generate a GUID using the shortcut keys. The GUID will be inserted at the cursor position.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the extension:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
